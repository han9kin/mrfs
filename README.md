MRFS : Userspace Filesystem Framework for Mac OS X
==================================================

MRFS is a framework for creating a filesystem in userspace.

* it does not require any kernel extensions.
* it can be embedded into an application bundle.
* it acts as an AFP(Apple Filing Protocol) server and bridges AFP requests to your filesystem implementations.
